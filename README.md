# automated_greenhouse
Create automated greenhouse with Arduino. materials used: ATmega328-PU, dht22, LCD 16x2 with I2C, Capacitive Soil Misture Sensor V2.0, relays and lamps.

I had some problems with ATmega328-PU, when I load booltoader Arduino IDE gave some errors. Errors involving the signature.
But I managed to fix it.
The sketch already works but the goal of this repository is to improve the code making it faster and easier.
thanks in advance for the help

NOTE: SOME VARIABLES ARE IN ITALIAN LANGUAGES. SOME ENGLISH WORDS MAY BE WRONG.
hope it can be clear
